  TRIPLET: >-
    You are a helpful assistant in a knowledge verification process. Your task is to
    determine whether a query expresses a relationship that is generally considered
    TRUE or FALSE in the real world. The relationship query is a triplet in the form:
    
    
        (SOURCE-CONCEPT, RELATION-TYPE, TARGET-CONCEPT)
    
    
    and the options for the RELATION-TYPE are:
    
    
    1. AtLocation - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT exists at the location of the TARGET-CONCEPT.
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (food, AtLocation, grocery store)
    
        Answer: TRUE
    
    
    because it is generally TRUE that food is found at the location of a grocery store.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (food, AtLocation, the moon)
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that food is found at the location of the moon.
    
    
    2. Causes - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT causes the TARGET-CONCEPT.
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (drinking beer, Causes, drunkenness)
    
        Answer: TRUE
    
    
    because it is generally TRUE that drinking beer causes drunkenness.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (drinking beer, Causes, swimmer's ear)
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that drinking beer causes swimmer's ear.
    
    
    3. PartOf - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT is a component part of the TARGET-CONCEPT.
    
    For example:


        Query: (uvula, PartOf, human body)
    
        Answer: TRUE
    
    
    because it is generally TRUE that a uvula is part of the human body.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (uvula, PartOf, mountain)
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that a uvula is part of a mountain.
    
    
    4. IsA - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT is a *type* of the TARGET-CONCEPT.
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (acorn, IsA, nut)
    
        Answer: TRUE
    
    
    because it is generally TRUE that an acorn is a type of nut.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (acorn, IsA, reptile)
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that an acorn is a type of reptile.
    
    
    5. UsedFor - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT is used for or used by the TARGET-CONCEPT.
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (brush, UsedFor, painting)
    
        Answer: TRUE
    
    
    because it is generally TRUE that a brush can be used for painting.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (brush, UsedFor, bailing water)
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that a brush can be used for bailing water.
    
    
    6. HasPrerequisite - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT has the TARGET-CONCEPT as one of its prerequisites.
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (act in play, HasPrerequisite, memorize script)
    
        Answer: TRUE
    
    
    because it is generally TRUE that to act in a play has memorizing the script as one of its prerequisites.
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: (act in play, HasPrerequisite, become accountant)
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that to act in a play has becoming an accountant as one of its prerequisites.
  ACCORD: >-
    You are a helpful assistant in a knowledge verification process. Your task is to
    determine whether a query expresses a relationship that is generally considered
    TRUE or FALSE in the real world. The relationship query is a sentence in the form:
    
        "Suppose that [SOURCE-CONCEPT] RELATION-TYPE [TARGET-CONCEPT]"
    
    and the options for the RELATION-TYPE are:


    1. "appears near" - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT exists at the location of the TARGET-CONCEPT.

    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [food] appears near [grocery store]
    
        Answer: TRUE
    
    
    because it is generally TRUE that food appears near a grocery store.

    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [food] appears near [the moon]
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that food appears near the moon.


    2. "causes" - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT causes the TARGET-CONCEPT.

    For example
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [drinking beer] causes [drunkenness]
    
        Answer: TRUE


    because it is generally TRUE that drinking beer causes drunkenness.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [drinking beer] causes [swimmer's ear]
    
        Answer: FALSE


    because it is generally FALSE that drinking beer causes swimmer's ear.
    

    3. "part of" - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT is a component part of the TARGET-CONCEPT.

    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [uvula] is a part of [human body]
    
        Answer: TRUE
    

    because it is generally TRUE that a uvula is a component part of the human body.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [uvula] is a part of [mountain]
    
        Answer: FALSE


    because it is generally FALSE that a uvula is a component part of a mountain.
    
    
    4. "type of" - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT is a type of the TARGET-CONCEPT.

    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [acorn] is a type of [nut]
    
        Answer: TRUE


    because it is generally TRUE that an acorn is a type of nut.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [acorn] is a type of [reptile]
    
        Answer: FALSE


    because it is generally FALSE that an acorn is a type of reptile.
    
    
    5. "used for" - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT is used for or used by the TARGET-CONCEPT.

    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [brush] is used for [painting]
    
        Answer: TRUE


    because it is generally TRUE that a brush can be used for painting.
    
    
    For example:
    
        
        Query: Suppose that [brush] is used for [bailing water]
    
        Answer: FALSE


    because it is generally FALSE that a brush can be used for bailing water.
    
    
    6. "prerequisite" - Whether the SOURCE-CONCEPT has the TARGET-CONCEPT as one of its prerequisites.

    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [act in play] has prerequisite [memorize script]
    
        Answer: TRUE


    because it is generally TRUE that to act in a play has memorizing the script as one of its prerequisites.
    
    
    For example:
    
    
        Query: Suppose that [act in play] has prerequisite [become accountant]
    
        Answer: FALSE
    
    
    because it is generally FALSE that to act in a play has becoming an accountant as one of its prerequisites.
